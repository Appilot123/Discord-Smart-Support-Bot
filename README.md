<h1 align="center">Discord Smart Support Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:

This project is a smart Discord bot built with ChatGPT-4 integration to handle customer support queries directly within a server's ticket system. It connects with tools like Ticket Tool to detect and respond in open support threads, helping server admins streamline customer engagement.

Beyond answering questions, the bot subtly nudges users to join a backup community channel, using 3–4 human-like conversational prompts. It’s an ideal solution for servers looking to automate basic support while maintaining a personal feel.


## Core Features:
- **Natural-Language Support Interactions:** Seamless replies using ChatGPT-4 with context-aware messaging.
- **Ticket Tool Integration:** Hooks into open tickets and threads automatically without manual setup.
- **Soft Conversion Funnel:** Uses multi-step chat prompts to nudge users toward joining backup channels—without being pushy.
